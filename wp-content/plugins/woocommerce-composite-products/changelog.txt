 * Fix - Modified composite parent/child weight and dimension keys in WC API order response data, depending on the "Per-Item Shipping" option state and exact cart package content.

 * Fix - Handling of composited products in coupons. Coupon validity of composited items is now inherited from their parents - specifically: A coupon cannot be valid for a composited item if the composite that contains it is excluded from the coupon.
